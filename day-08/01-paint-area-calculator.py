# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover
# 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
#
# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.
#
# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
#
# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
#
#                            = 1.6
#
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
